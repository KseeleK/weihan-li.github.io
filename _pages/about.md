About me
======
I am currently a 4th-year undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at the Zhejiang University.

My research interests primarily lie in the intersection between machine learning and neuroscience. I am particularly interested in developing and applying neuroscience thoeories to improve artificial neural networks and understand the mechanisms of artificial intelligence.
